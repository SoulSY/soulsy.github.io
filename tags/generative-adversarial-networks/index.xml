      <description>Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) operate by having two neural networks compete against each other. This structure has enabled the generation of complex patterns in deep learning and plays an essential role in various application areas.
Characteristics GAN consists of two neural networks, the generator and discriminator, competing with each other in a learning process, allowing the creation of complex data. However, the learning process requires a delicate balance and can be challenging.</description>
