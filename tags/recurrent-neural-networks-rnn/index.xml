      <description>Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) are a type of artificial neural network designed to recognize patterns in sequences of data, such as text, genomes, handwriting, or spoken words. Unlike traditional neural networks, RNNs have loops, allowing information to be passed from one step in the sequence to the next.
Characteristics RNNs are particularly known for their characteristic ability to &amp;ldquo;remember&amp;rdquo; previous inputs in the sequence using their hidden state, which makes them very effective for tasks that involve sequential data.</description>
